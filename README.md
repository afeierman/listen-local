This is an beta version of Listen Local, a tool that creates playlists of artists playing at local venues. It is built on the flask web framework.

Important note: This code will not work unless the user has registered a spotify application at https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications, and has placed their client ID and client secret key into the application code. 

This code was created as part of the NYC Data Science Academy curriculum. This is my outcome for project 2, which focused on web scraping.
