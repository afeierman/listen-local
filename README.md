This is an alpha version of Listen Local, a tool that creates playlists of artists playing at local venues. 

It utilizes flask and spotipy heavily on the back-end, and jQuery and moment.js on the front-end. 

Important note: This code will not work unless the user has registered a spotify application at https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications, and has placed their client ID and client secret key into the application code. 

This code was created as part of the NYC Data Science Academy curriculum. This is my outcome for project 2, which focused on web scraping. 

This project relies heavily on the spotify-flask-auth-examples repo. Big thanks to them.
