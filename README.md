It's been a long day at work, and you're excited to get home. On your commute home, you walk by a local concert venue. "I should get out more," you think to yourself, "I've always wanted to see a concert there."

It _should_ be easy to discover bands playing at local venues. Enter Listen Local, a simple application to see what bands are playing a local concert venue, and automatically create playlists of upcoming music. That way, you can sample the tunes of upcoming shows, and finally get out to that local concert venue you walk by every day.

This is an beta version of Listen Local, a tool that creates playlists of artists playing at local venues. It is built on the flask web framework.

This code was created as part of the NYC Data Science Academy curriculum. This is my outcome for project 2, which focused on web scraping. Scraping for this project was done using scrapy and Beautiful Soup.

Note: This code will not work unless the user has registered a spotify application at https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications, and has placed their client ID and client secret key into the application code.
