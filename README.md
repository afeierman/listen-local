It's been a long day at work, and you're excited to get home. On your commute home, you walk by a local concert venue. "I should get out more," you think to yourself, "I've always wanted to see a concert there."

It _should_ be easy to discover bands playing at local venues. Enter Listen Local, a simple application to see what bands are playing a local concert venue, and automatically create playlists of upcoming music. That way, you can sample the tunes of upcoming shows, and finally get out to that local concert venue you walk by every day.
